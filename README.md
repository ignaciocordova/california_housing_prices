# california_housing_prices
Multiple Linear Regression for estimating housing prices in California.

This project includes: 
  1. Data exploration
  2. Data cleaning
  3. Data visualization
  4. OneHotEncoder for Categorical Data
  5. Dummy Variable trap 
  6. Feature Scaling
  7. Training and testing of a model

For this project I used Pandas for data exploration and Matplotlib for data visualization. I used Numpy library to build the feature matrix and output vector. Finally, the Scikit-learn library was used for implementing the Multiple Linear Regression model.
